# Target_PS5_Stock_Check
A chrome extension that checks if the PS5 is out of stock. If it isn't Blast music!

I did not include the sound file here since it contains copy write stuff

I paired this with an auto refresher so the webpage would refresh every 30 seconds. Every time the page loads this code runs

The chrome browser does not allow a webpage to play music if the user has not interacted with the page. So if you set this up by itself it won't play the music when the time comes. To overcome this I downloaded an autoclicker and had the program click the webpage in a spot with no links every 500 miliseconds so that once the page loads, it get's clicked by the auto clicker before this code runs so that if it is back in stock the music can play.
